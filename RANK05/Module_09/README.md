# C++ - Module 09 Readme

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for Module 09 of C++ programming exercises. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of C++ programming using the Standard Template Library (STL). The exercises cover topics such as handling Bitcoin exchange rates, implementing Reverse Polish Notation calculations, and sorting integer sequences using merge-insertion sort algorithms.

## Objective of the Project
The objective of Module 09 is to familiarize learners with advanced C++ programming concepts, emphasizing the use of STL containers and algorithms. By completing these exercises, participants will gain proficiency in:
- Implementing solutions using STL containers like vectors and maps.
- Designing classes and functions adhering to C++98 standards.
- Managing memory and avoiding memory leaks.
- Developing Makefiles for compiling and managing project dependencies.
- Handling various input formats and error conditions effectively.

## Contents
This repository includes:
- **Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange**
  - Program to calculate Bitcoin values based on historical data.
- **Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**
  - Implementation of a calculator using RPN expressions.
- **Exercise 02: PmergeMe**
  - Sorting positive integer sequences using merge-insertion sort.

Each exercise folder (`ex00/`, `ex01/`, `ex02/`) contains the respective implementation files (`main.cpp`, `*.cpp`, `*.hpp`) and a `Makefile` to compile the code.

## Module-Specific Rules
- Each exercise must use at least one STL container.
- Design considerations like Orthodox Canonical Form for classes are required.
- Makefiles must include standard rules (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`).
- Specific rules apply to error handling, input/output formats, and algorithm implementations.
